  "instructions": "Focus on code quality, documentation, and testing. Ensure the code you write passes builds, linting, and tests. After every code change, run commands together to minimize roundtrips, e.g., 'npm build && npm lint && npm test'. Address any errors from linting or tests immediately. Consider edge cases and performance implications.",
